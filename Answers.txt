1.  By default, Django signals are executed synchronously. This means that when a signal is sent, the receiver function connected to that signal will execute immediately, within the same thread and process as the sender. This synchronous execution can be demonstrated with the following code snippet:

Code Snippet to Test Synchronous Execution of Django Signals
In this example, we’ll use Django’s post_save signal for a model, which is triggered after a model instance is saved.

models.py:

from django.db import models
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
import time

class ExampleModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

@receiver(post_save, sender=ExampleModel)
def example_signal_receiver(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print("Signal received. Starting long process...")
    time.sleep(5)  # Simulate a long-running process
    print("Signal processing completed.")

Testing the Execution Time:

In a Django shell or a view, we can test the synchronous nature of the signal as follows:

from myapp.models import ExampleModel
import time

print("Creating ExampleModel instance...")
start_time = time.time()

example = ExampleModel.objects.create(name="Test")

end_time = time.time()
print(f"Total time taken: {end_time - start_time} seconds")

Explanation and Expected Output
When ExampleModel.objects.create() is called, it triggers the post_save signal, which invokes example_signal_receiver.
The example_signal_receiver function then sleeps for 5 seconds.
Since Django signals are executed synchronously by default, the script will wait for the signal receiver to complete before continuing.
The output will show that the "Total time taken" includes the delay caused by time.sleep(5) in the signal receiver.
Expected Output:


Creating ExampleModel instance...
Signal received. Starting long process...
Signal processing completed.
Total time taken: 5.0 seconds


The fact that the "Total time taken" includes the delay from time.sleep(5) in the receiver demonstrates that the signal is executed synchronously by default. If it were asynchronous, the total time would be nearly instantaneous, as the main thread would continue running without waiting for the receiver to finish.


 2) Yes, Django signals run in the same thread as the caller by default. This means that the receiver function connected to a signal will execute in the same thread that emitted (or "sent") the signal.

Here’s a code snippet to demonstrate this behavior:

Code Snippet to Test if Django Signals Run in the Same Thread as the Caller

1. model.py

from django.db import models
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
import threading

class ExampleModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

@receiver(post_save, sender=ExampleModel)
def example_signal_receiver(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print("Signal received.")
    print("Receiver Thread ID:", threading.get_ident())  # Prints the thread ID for the receiver

2.Testing the Thread IDs:

In a Django shell or view, we can check the thread ID of both the caller and the signal receiver as follows:
 from myapp.models import ExampleModel
import threading

print("Caller Thread ID:", threading.get_ident())  # Prints the thread ID for the caller

# Creating an instance of ExampleModel, which triggers the post_save signal
example = ExampleModel.objects.create(name="Test")

Explanation and Expected Output
When ExampleModel.objects.create() is called, it triggers the post_save signal, which invokes the example_signal_receiver.
Both the caller and receiver print their thread IDs using threading.get_ident().
If the signal runs in the same thread as the caller, the printed thread IDs for both the caller and the receiver will be identical.
Expected Output:

Caller Thread ID: 140675189430016
Signal received.
Receiver Thread ID: 140675189430016


Since both the caller and receiver print the same thread ID, this confirms that Django signals run in the same thread as the caller by default. If the signals were running in a different thread, we would see different thread IDs for the caller and the receiver.


3)Yes, by default, Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller. This means that if the transaction in which a signal is sent fails or rolls back, the actions performed by the signal handler will also be rolled back.

Code Snippet to Test if Django Signals Run in the Same Database Transaction as the Caller
Here’s an example demonstrating this behavior using Django’s transaction.atomic to ensure that the signal’s actions are rolled back if the main transaction fails.

models.py:

from django.db import models, transaction
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver

class ExampleModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class SignalModel(models.Model):
    message = models.CharField(max_length=100)

@receiver(post_save, sender=ExampleModel)
def example_signal_receiver(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    # Attempt to create an instance in SignalModel
    SignalModel.objects.create(message="Signal triggered")

Testing the Transaction Rollback Behavior:

In a Django view or shell, let’s wrap the ExampleModel creation in an atomic transaction block and deliberately raise an exception to test if the signal’s actions roll back with the main transaction.

from django.db import transaction
from myapp.models import ExampleModel, SignalModel

# Clear out previous data
SignalModel.objects.all().delete()

try:
    with transaction.atomic():
        # This will trigger the signal
        example = ExampleModel.objects.create(name="Test")
        print("Signal action committed.")

        # Raise an exception to trigger rollback
        raise Exception("Force rollback")
except Exception as e:
    print("Transaction rolled back:", str(e))

# Check if the SignalModel entry was created or rolled back
print("SignalModel entries:", SignalModel.objects.all())


Explanation and Expected Output
Explanation:

When ExampleModel.objects.create() is called, it triggers the post_save signal, which attempts to create an entry in SignalModel.
Since the main transaction raises an exception right after the signal is triggered, the entire transaction (including the signal’s actions) should roll back.
Expected Output:

You should see that no entry was created in SignalModel, indicating that the signal’s actions were rolled back with the main transaction.

Signal action committed.
Transaction rolled back: Force rollback
SignalModel entries: <QuerySet []>

This output demonstrates that Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller by default. If the transaction fails, the actions performed by the signal handler are also rolled back.



TOPIC: CUSTOM CLASSES IN PYTHON
 To create a Rectangle class in Python with the required features:

class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length: int, width: int):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def __iter__(self):
        # We yield a dictionary with 'length' first, followed by 'width'
        yield {'length': self.length}
        yield {'width': self.width}

Explanation:
Constructor: __init__ initializes Rectangle instances with length and width.
Iterator: __iter__ makes Rectangle instances iterable. It yields a dictionary with the length first ({'length': value}), then the width ({'width': value}).


Example Usage

# Create a Rectangle instance
rect = Rectangle(5, 10)

# Iterate over the instance
for attribute in rect:
    print(attribute)


Expected Output

{'length': 5}
{'width': 10}

This structure allows the instance to be iterable and gives the attributes in the specified format and order.
